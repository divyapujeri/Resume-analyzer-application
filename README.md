Resume Analyzer Application

Overview

The Resume Analyzer Application is a Python-based tool designed to streamline the resume screening process. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), the application analyzes resumes, extracts key information like skills, education, and work experience, and evaluates each resume for relevant job-specific attributes. This assists recruiters and hiring managers in identifying suitable candidates quickly and effectively.

Technologies

	•	Python: Core programming language for the project.
	•	NLP Libraries: Libraries such as spaCy and NLTK for natural language processing and text analysis.
	•	PDFMiner: For extracting text from PDF resume files.
	•	Streamlit: Used to create an interactive web interface for the application.
	•	Streamlit Tags: Allows for dynamic tagging and selection in the interface, enabling users to specify skills and keywords to focus on.
	•	Flask: Web framework for backend API functionality (if applicable).
	•	MySQL or SQLite: Database options for storing and managing resumes and analysis results.
	•	HTML/CSS: For additional front-end customization.
